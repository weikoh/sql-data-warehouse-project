# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
I created this repository with help of tutorials:
- [SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project | Full Hands-On Portfolio Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jGhQpbzHes)
- [SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project | Like I Do in My Real Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cJ5Ji8zSDg)

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.
# Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
# Project Overview
This project involves:
- **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
